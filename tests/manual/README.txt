Focused iSH-AOK guest regression suite

These sources are exposed inside the guest at /AOK/tests.

Quick start:
  sh /AOK/tests/setup-regressions.sh --install-deps --run

If a C toolchain is already present:
  sh /AOK/tests/setup-regressions.sh --run

Verbose mode:
  sh /AOK/tests/setup-regressions.sh --run -v

Simple amd64 JIT timing benchmark inside the guest:
  sh /AOK/tests/amd64_jit_bench.sh
  For short commands, use -n to amplify timing differences, e.g.:
  sh /AOK/tests/amd64_jit_bench.sh -n 5

Host-side amd64 GAS encoding probe:
  tests/manual/amd64_gas_probe.sh -r /path/to/amd64-root-with-binutils
  This compares suspect GNU as mnemonic encodings against paired .byte
  encodings and falls back to one-file-per-case when as aborts early.

Focused tests:
  atomics32.c          Combined atomic probe with single-case and stress checks
  atomic_xadd32.c      lock xaddl coverage
  atomic_cmpxchg32.c   lock cmpxchgl coverage
  atomic_cmpxchg8b.c   lock cmpxchg8b coverage
  atomic_logic32.c     lock orl/andl/xorl coverage
  signal_core.c        Core signal delivery, wait, and signalfd coverage
  signal_restart.c     SA_RESTART behavior for read and waitpid
  signal_realtime.c    sigqueue and realtime queued-signal coverage
  signal_altstack.c    sigaltstack and SA_ONSTACK coverage
  signal_poll.c        poll/select/pselect signal interruption coverage
  eventfd_interrupt.c  eventfd read/poll interruption via the generic wait path
  futex_core.c         FUTEX_WAIT/FUTEX_WAKE timeout, wake, and signal coverage
  process_lifecycle.c  fork/exec/vfork/wait and signal inheritance coverage
  pthread_sync.c       mutex/condvar/rwlock/timed wait and pthread_once coverage
  amd64_regress.c      amd64 cross-page write, exec loader, fcntl race, and cc1 stress
  amd64_gas_probe.sh   host-side GNU as immediate/register encoding probe

All focused tests accept -v or --verbose. Without it they print only failures
plus the final PASS/FAIL line for each test.
